TODO:
-- manage image scaling for larger areas
-- dem_extractor should return an optimal scale factor so that no line hits another, and this should be applied in the drawing
-- fix updating so:
    a) cut pattern updates with map dragging
    b) direction & slice number controls update cut immediately
-- add cut frame to outlines
-- output to SVG, not just PNG
-- get signal when map is loaded, so cut pattern appears on load
-- dropdown menus (direction) doesn't change cut pattern immediately; waits on next action
-- need search field for google map location
-- slices slider is usually a couple iterations behind with the results it displays
-- open & read DEM data
-- TESTING.


Destination:
xx add adequate space at top of frame so contours aren't cut off the top
xx color cut/fold lines differentially
xx add fold/ frame lines to drawn canvas
xx all lat_long regions are currently warped into squares.  Better would
    be to take into account the aspect ratio of the region being graphed.
xx be able to sample from multiple map tiles
xx West & east orientations don't work yet.
xx finish dem_extractor.cpp
xx add makefile for cgi.  This needs to set permissions correctly (711) for running on Apache.
xx- live-updating HTML5 canvas for use on a website
xx interactive sliders
xx google maps interface for choosing regions
    - overlay for regions with available data
    - some means of acquiring more data - api for ASTER data?
-- All data cached on server in formats with as little data as
    reasonably possible.  90m grids are probably too dense
xx use cached DEM data so we don't have to download more.

BUGS:
-- aspect ratio calculations wrong: taller map yield almost square cut. 
    Short map yields very short cut
xx Coffeescript vertical scaling scales the lines we draw as well 
as their positions.  Really, we just want to scale the positions 
and have all the lines be the same thickness.  (alternately, set
line thickness commensurate with scaling so lines always _appear_
the same thickness)
