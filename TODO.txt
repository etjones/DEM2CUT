TODO:
-- add makefile for cgi.  This needs to set permissions correctly (711) for running on Apache.
-- finish dem_extractor.cpp
-- all lat_long regions are currently warped into squares.  Better would
    be to take into account the aspect ratio of the region being graphed.
-- open & read DEM data


-- TESTING.
-- West & east orientations don't work yet.


Destination:
xx- live-updating HTML5 canvas for use on a website
xx interactive sliders
xx google maps interface for choosing regions
    - overlay for regions with available data
    - some means of acquiring more data - api for ASTER data?
-- All data cached on server in formats with as little data as
    reasonably possible.  90m grids are probably too dense
xx use cached DEM data so we don't have to download more.

BUGS:
xx Coffeescript vertical scaling scales the lines we draw as well 
as their positions.  Really, we just want to scale the positions 
and have all the lines be the same thickness.  (alternately, set
line thickness commensurate with scaling so lines always _appear_
the same thickness)
