TODO:
-- all lat_long regions are currently warped into squares.  Better would
    be to take into account the aspect ratio of the region being graphed.
-- open & read DEM data

-- use cached DEM data so we don't have to download more.
-- TESTING.
-- West & east orientations don't work yet.


Destination:
- live-updating SVG for use on a website
- interactive sliders
- google maps interface for choosing regions
- overlay for regions with available data
- some means of acquiring more data - api for ASTER data?
